# iOS Sample App

Sample iOS app written the way I write iOS apps because I cannot share the app I currently work on.

**SwiftUI**: I created a SwiftUI version of this sample app, using a bit defferent concepts: https://github.com/igorkulman/SwiftUISampleApp

## Shown concepts

### Architecture concepts

* MVVM
* [Data Binding](https://blog.kulman.sk/using-data-binding-in-ios/)
* Dependencies management

### Other concepts

* Localization to 2 languages with String catalogs
* Continuous integration with Github Actions
* Unit testing, including [testing view controllers for leaks](https://blog.kulman.sk/unit-testing-memory-leaks/)
* Creating a view controller in code with dependency injection
* Using static UITableView cells in a typed way with enums
* Creating simple cells with UIListContentConfiguration
* Automated AppStore screenshots taking in multiple languages
* Adding custom reactive properties
* Basic Dark mode support
* Custom operator for simple UI code
* Structured logging
